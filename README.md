Gandalf
=======

The idea behind Gandalf is to have a pet-project for [Codurance](http://codurance.com) apprentices and craftsmen.
It uses Java 8, AngularJS, Jade, SparkJava, and will use some other stuff in the future as well. 

To run it:

> mvn jetty:run

Or just execute the [GandalfLauncher](https://github.com/sandromancuso/gandalf/blob/master/src/main/java/com/codurance/GandalfLauncher.java) class.
 
Then go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

To run the tests:

> mvn clean test

Or just execute [JourneyTestSuite](https://github.com/codurance/gandalf/blob/master/src/test/java/journey/JourneyTestSuite.java) class.
